A program for simulating the life of plants and the changes of radiation on an alien planet. The plants' nutrient levels change according to the current type of radiation, and in response they send out signals to influence how the radiation will change the next day. If a plant runs out of nutrients (or, in some cases, if it has too much), it dies, and can no longer affect or be affected by the radiation.

The program has two test projects. UnitTest contains test classes that test how each class functions separately, while FullTests checks the end result of full simulations.

Written in C# in Visual Studio for .NET 8.0.
