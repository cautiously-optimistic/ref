                            <strong>Sunless Sea</strong> is a wonderful game much praised for its athmosphere and writing. It deals with
                            themes of madness, the uncaring vastness of the sea, the dangers it presents and the many
                            horrors lurking just beneath – fitting, then, that every time I boot up this game I feel
                            <em>utterly lost</em> amid the sprawling web of tasks, choices, and the many moving parts. The point
                            of this website is to clear up some of that confusion and provide a few <strong>cheat sheets</strong> that
                            might be referenced during gameplay, and hopefully help make sense of this vast and
                            labyrinthine game.
                            <br>
                            But why not just use the Sunless Sea Wiki, I hear you ask. The truth is, the Wiki manages,
                            somehow, to be even <em>more</em> confusing than the game – an impressive feat, considering. If you'd like to check it out anyways, you can do so <a href="https://sunlesssea.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Sunless_Sea_Wiki">here!</a>
                            <br>
                            I hope this guide will prove helpful to you. Welcome, friend, to <strong>The Almanac</strong>!

                                        The trailer of Sunless Sea. The entire video is accompanied by tense music.<br>
                                        The trailer starts with an overhead view of a sailing ship. It is dark, but the ship's lantern illuminates some of the water in front of it. Suddenly, the sea floor opens up to reveal a huge eye, significantly bigger than the ship itself. Words appear in the center of the screen reading: "The sea does not forgive".<br>
                                        The next clip shows a ship sailing by an island upon which stands the Chapel of Lights. It is snowing. Words appear again: "and it will not forgive you".<br>
                                        In the next clip, the ship sails past Mount Palmerston. A single word appears this time: "Explore".<br>
                                        Then the ship is shown sailing by a huge hand made of stone, on the Sea of Statues. In the corner there's an excerpt from the ship's log: "16th September, 1888. We have entered the Sea of Statues. Giants gape at us. Kingeater's Castle rises ahead, where fools give up their future." The words "Sea of Statues" and "where fools give up their future" are written in lighter text as a means of highlighting them.<br>
                                        Cut to the ship sailing towards the port of the Iron Republic. Another excerpt from the ship's log: "14th March, 1891. A crate of human souls. It has never known the tender touch of the Imperial Customs stamp." Here, "human souls" and "Imperial Customs stamp" are highlighted.<br>
                                        Another word appears in the centre: "Battle". The next clips show the ship being fired at by an enemy ship, the ship firing at a Lifeberg, sending out a flare and being attacked by a Lorn-Fluke.<br>
                                        New words appear reading: "Lose your mind". Cut to the ship sailing toward the Dawn Machine. Words repeating "The Sun! The Sun!" appear in quick succession, filling up most of the screen.<br>
                                        "Eat your crew". The ship sails between the ribs a of huge, long-dead sea monster. In one corner, an excerpt from the ship's log: "2nd October, 1889. Starvation walked the ship. We were merciful: our knives were sharp." "Starvation", "merciful", "knives" and "sharp" are highlighted.<br>
                                        A single word: "Die". A Bound Shark hits the ship, and as the camera fades to black, another excerpt from the ship's log appears: "23rd May, 1898. Screams - dark water - the unforgettable sound of a ship's spine breaking.", "ship's spine breaking" is highlighted.<br>
                                        The next set of clips shows two quotes from reviews of the game, with the ship sailing by various landmarks in the background.<br>
                                        "...the most delicious collection of words in all of gaming", from Rock, Paper, Shotgun. The ship sails by Frostfound.<br>
                                        "Survival exploration at its most terrifying", from Eurogamer. The ship sails by Saviour's Rocks.<br>
                                        The video fades to a title screen showing a single light buoy bobbing in the water, the words: "Sunless Sea, from the creators of Fallen London", and the three game platforms the game is available on: Steam, GOG.com and Humble Bundle.

                                Doesn’t that sound <em>exciting</em>? Sunless Sea truly shines when it comes to its <strong>writing</strong>, its
                                <strong>atmosphere</strong> and <strong>worldbuilding</strong>. It takes place in and expands upon the richly detailed
                                universe of the game studio’s first game, <strong>Fallen London</strong>, and is, in turn, expanded upon
                                by its indirect sequel, <strong>Sunless Skies</strong>.
                                <br>
                                The stories, the mystery, and the worldbuilding are what drew me to this game, and to
                                this day I consider it – along with its sister games – one of my <em>favourite</em> (mostly)
                                written media I’ve had the pleasure to experience. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I
                                do.
